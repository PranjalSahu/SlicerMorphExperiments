## What is this project ?

This project is **NOT** the official Slicer repository. It is a fork of the SlicerMorph repository hosted at https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMorph.

It is used to organize experiments, coordinate work done by the [KitwareMedical][KitwareMedical] team and develop modules that will eventually be contributed back to the official repository.

The overall goal is to ultimately help with:

> The integration of maintainable and effective methods for point cloud alignment, i.e. registration, of large-scale SlicerMorph datasets.
>
> This includes the integration and extension of Insight Toolkit (ITK) registration methods, and Visualization Toolkit (VTK) point cloud filtering and transformation methods, as well as the testing & evaluation of the effectiveness of these methods on sample SlicerMorph datasets.

### How to contribute improved SlicerMorph modules ?

Topics should be based of the [master][] branch and may be contributed as pull requests created against the upstream SlicerMorph repository.
